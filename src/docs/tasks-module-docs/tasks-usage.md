## Creating Tasks

To create a new task:

1. Open the Task Modal (default hotkey: CMD+OPTION+T)
2. Enter a brief task description
3. Click "Add Task" or press Mod+Enter

The AI will generate a clear, actionable task, potentially with subtasks if appropriate.

## Viewing Tasks

To view your task list:

1. Use the "View tasks" command (default hotkey: CMD+OPTION+V)
2. This will open your designated tasks file in Obsidian

Alternatively, you can manually navigate to your tasks file in your Obsidian vault.

## Using Quick Access

The "T" button on the status bar provides quick access to task creation and viewing:

1. Click the "T" button to open the Task Modal
2. Use the dropdown menu to switch between task creation and viewing

## Batch Task Creation

For creating multiple tasks in succession:

1. Open the Task Modal
2. Enter your first task description
3. Use Shift+Mod+Enter to add the task and keep the modal open
4. The modal will remain open, allowing you to immediately enter another task
5. Repeat steps 2-4 as needed for all your tasks
6. Use Mod+Enter or click "Add Task" to add the final task and close the modal

This feature allows for efficient task entry during planning sessions or when you have multiple tasks to add at once.

## Best Practices

- Use concise language when describing tasks for optimal AI generation
- Regularly review and update your task list to maintain productivity
- Experiment with different task prompts to find the structure that works best for you
- Utilize the batch creation feature for efficient task entry during planning sessions

## Integration with Obsidian

- Tasks are stored as standard Markdown checkboxes, compatible with Obsidian's native task handling
- You can interact with tasks directly in your tasks file, marking them complete or editing as needed
- Consider using Obsidian's search and linking features to reference tasks in your notes
