## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Chat not loading**: Ensure you have an active internet connection and that the plugin is up to date.
2. **Context files not working**: Verify that the selected files are accessible and contain relevant information.
3. **High token count**: Try splitting your conversation into smaller chunks or starting a new chat.

- If you experience slowdowns, try reducing the number of active chats or context files.

## Customization

- Adjust the chat folder location in settings to organize your chat files according to your preferences.
- Experiment with different AI models (if available) to find the best fit for your needs.
