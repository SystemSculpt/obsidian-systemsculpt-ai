/**
 * DANGER: Global Obsidian Overrides
 *
 * THIS FILE SHOULD REMAIN EMPTY.
 *
 * If you need to add CSS that affects Obsidian's global UI (not scoped to
 * SystemSculpt views), you MUST:
 *
 * 1. Get explicit approval before adding any styles here
 * 2. Document WHY this global override is absolutely necessary
 * 3. Ensure it cannot be achieved with a scoped selector
 * 4. Test thoroughly that it doesn't break other plugins or Obsidian's UI
 *
 * Any CSS added here is a potential source of bugs like the folder
 * indentation issue (favorite-toggle.css:477 from Dec 2025).
 *
 * The CSS lint script (npm run lint:css) will flag problematic selectors.

/* NO GLOBAL OVERRIDES - KEEP THIS FILE EMPTY */
