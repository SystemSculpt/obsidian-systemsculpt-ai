/**
 * Obsidian View Content Overrides - SystemSculpt Plugin
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This file contains scoped CSS that targets Obsidian's native
 * .workspace-leaf-content selector BUT ONLY when our plugin views are active.
 *
 * ALL selectors here MUST include [data-type="systemsculpt-*"] to ensure
 * they only affect our plugin's views, not other plugins or Obsidian's UI.
 *
 * The CSS lint script (npm run lint:css) will catch any unscoped selectors.
