# Daily Vault

Daily Vault helps you create and manage daily notes, run review flows, and track streak/analytics (depending on your configuration).

## Configure

Obsidian Settings → **SystemSculpt AI** → **Daily Vault**:

- Daily note naming and directory
- Template configuration
- Review flows and reminders
- Streak tracking and optional status indicators

## Commands

Daily Vault commands (see [Commands & hotkeys](commands.md)):

- **Open Today's Daily Note**
- **Create Daily Note**
- **Open Yesterday's Daily Note**
- **Start Daily Review**
- **Start Weekly Review**
- **View Daily Streak**
- **Open Daily Vault Settings**

## Notes

- If streak data looks wrong, verify your daily note directory/template settings and ensure the notes are being created where the plugin expects.
- If you recently changed the daily note directory, you may need to re-open today's note once so the plugin re-syncs its internal state.
