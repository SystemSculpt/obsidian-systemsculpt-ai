# Audio & transcription

SystemSculpt AI includes audio recording and transcription tooling (depending on your configuration and license/features).

## Configure

Obsidian Settings → **SystemSculpt AI** → **Audio & Transcription**:

- Microphone selection (where applicable)
- Transcription provider/model selection
- Post-processing options (where applicable)

## Commands and ribbon actions

See: [Commands & hotkeys](commands.md) and [Ribbon icons](ribbon-icons.md).

- **Toggle Audio Recorder** (`Mod`+`R`) — start/stop recording
- **Open Meeting Processor** — open the meeting processing modal
- Ribbon: **Process Meeting Audio** — opens the same meeting processor entrypoint

## Tips

- If transcription fails, first confirm your provider key/endpoint and that the selected model supports audio/transcription on your provider.
- If you’re using a local transcription server, confirm it’s reachable from Obsidian and not blocked by OS/network restrictions.
